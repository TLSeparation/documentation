Welcome
=======

Welcome to TLSeparation, a Python library for material separation from tree/forests 3d point clouds.

Some features included in this package are:

* Automated scripts to perform separation from single tree data.
* Very extensible, modules and functions that can be imported to build a custom workflow.
* Separation functions based on topology and geometric arrangement of points.
* Filtering module to improve classification results.

This is still a work in progress, so it will keep developing over time. Altough it's status is still in development,
all core functions are testes and operational.
